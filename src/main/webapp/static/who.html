					<h1>Made with Openthings</h1>
					<p>Openthings is a platform for designers who want to go beyond consuming and become prosumers. By becoming productive-consumers people are able to flourish. The Openthings users are like bees spreading and sharing knowledge. Their knowledge is used to enhance the projects of other contributors. This system of sharing works both ways and is the fuel of Openthings.
Openthings is power through collaborative design - it is a community of prosumers.</p>

					<h1>The platform</h1>
					<p>Openthings is a platform passionate about collaborative development where sharing is the foundation. You are encouraged to get involved with your own and othersâ€™ design, everything is open.</p>
					<p>Openthings is a wikiPedia of projects. Everyone can work on a project uploaded to the platform and help evolve it. The platform facilitates anyone to share knowledge, ideas and skill. Together we can become prosumers instead of consumers. A productive consumer is most likely to feel more satisfied with themselves because of what they achieve. Join the global collaboration of Openthings and become a prosumer.</p>
