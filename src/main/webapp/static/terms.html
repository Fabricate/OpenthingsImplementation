				<h1>Openthings Terms of Service</h1>
				<p class="intro">If OpenThings makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <a href="https://openthings.wiki/terms">https://openthings.wiki/terms</a></p>

				<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While OpenThings prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that OpenThings cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>

				<h2>A. Account Terms</h2>

				<p>You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.</p>

				<p>You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>

				<p>You must provide your name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.</p>

				<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. OpenThings cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

				<p>You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p>

				<p>One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.</p>

				<p>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</p>

				<h2>B. API Terms</h2>

				<p>Customers may access their OpenThings account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses OpenThings, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:

				<p>You expressly understand and agree that OpenThings shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if OpenThings has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</p>

				<p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to OpenThings via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. OpenThings, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. OpenThings will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</p>

				<p>OpenThings reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>

				<h2>C. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms</h2>

				<p>All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information.</p>

				<p>An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.</p>

				<p>For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>

				<p>When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, OpenThings will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date.</p>

				<p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</p>

				<p>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, OpenThings will immediately charge or refund the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.</p>

				<p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. OpenThings does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>

				<h2>D. Cancellation and Termination</h2>

				<p>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple no questions asked cancellation link.</p>

				<p>All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.</p>

				<p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.</p>

				<p>OpenThings, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other OpenThings service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. OpenThings reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

				<h2>E. Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>

				<p>OpenThings reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p></p>

				<p>Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the OpenThings Site (OpenThings.com) or the Service itself.</p>

				<p>OpenThings shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>

				<p>You shall defend OpenThings against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against OpenThings by a third-party alleging that Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third-party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify OpenThings for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, OpenThings in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that OpenThings (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases OpenThings of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.</p>
